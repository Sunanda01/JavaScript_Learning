<!-- //EVENT PROPAGATION
    //It determines in which order the elements receive the event.
    //Two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, which an event occurs in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event. 
    //CAPTURE PHASE
        //Top to Bottom
        //Going from the window to the event target phase
    //BUBBLE PHASE
        //Bottom to Top
        //From the event target parent back to the window
      //Target Phase
        //It is the target phase
//EVENT BUBBLING
    //With event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer element
//EVENT CAPTURING
    //With event capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.
    //Capturing also known as "trickling", helps in remembering the propagation order.
//HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION
    //function which takes another function as an argument
//CALLBACK FUNCTION
    //function which get passed as an argument to an another function to be called back -->
